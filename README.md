# Siemens R&D Internship

* This repository contains daily progress of internship done at Siemens R&D under APC division specifically for learning concepts of Electrical Drives, Motion Control, PLC and application in the software used by Siemens(TIA Portal v14 and SCOUT v5.1) run on SIMATIC Field PG M4 machine provided by my guide.  
* This internship has two integral parts: Theory Learning and Practical Application (TIA Portal) Daily progress documents doesn’t segregate the two parts but the final report of two months will track progress in terms of those parts. 
* Week 2 onwards, the documents doesn’t separate day-wise learning but instead follows a concept wise approach. For example, Drives’ working and PLC Theory was done over several days so it can’t be segregated thus there’s no division as such. 
* For now the pdfs are uploaded, I'll try to make it in markdown format if time permits.
